This simple game was written in Processing3 in 2021.

It was part of an above AP game design course I took at The South Carolina Governor's School for Science and Mathematics.

This rock paper scissor style game features rudimentary AI with an enemy that chooses it's actions in response to the player's actions. 

*All of the art in this game is my own.
